# Parallel Routes

Parallel Routing allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages in the same layout. For highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites, Parallel Routing can be used to implement complex routing patterns.

For example, you can simultaneously render the team and analytics pages.

![Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

Parallel Routing allows you to define independent error and loading states for each route as they're being streamed in independently.

![Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes-cinematic-universe.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

Parallel Routing also allows you to conditionally render a slot based on certain conditions, such as authentication state. This enables fully separated code on the same URL.

## Convention

Parallel routes are created using named **slots**. Slots are defined with the `@folder` convention, and are passed to the same-level layout as props.

> Slots are _not_ route segments and _do not affect the URL structure_. The file path `/@team/members` would be accessible at `/members`.

For example, the following file structure defines two explicit slots: `@analytics` and `@team`.

![Convention](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes-file-system.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

The folder structure above means that the component in `app/layout.js` now accepts the `@analytics` and `@team` slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the `children` prop:

```tsx app/layout.tsx
export default function Layout(props: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  analytics: React.ReactNode
  team: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <>
      {props.children}
      {props.team}
      {props.analytics}
    </>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**: The `children` prop is an implicit slot that does not need to be mapped to a folder. This means `app/page.js` is equivalent to `app/@children/page.js`.

---

## Unmatched Routes

By default, the content rendered within a slot will match the current URL.

In the case of an unmatched slot, the content that Next.js renders differs based on the routing technique and folder structure.

---

### `default.js`

You can define a `default.js` file to render as a fallback when Next.js cannot recover a slot's active state based on the current URL.

Consider the following folder structure. The `@team` slot has a `settings` directory, but `@analytics` does not.

![default.js](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes-unmatched-routes.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

---

#### Navigation

On navigation, Next.js will render the slot's previously active state, even if it doesn't match the current URL.

---

#### Reload

On reload, Next.js will first try to render the unmatched slot's `default.js` file. If that's not available, a 404 gets rendered.

> The 404 for unmatched routes helps ensure that you don't accidentally render a route that shouldn't be parallel rendered.

---

## `useSelectedLayoutSegment(s)`

Both [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment) and [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) accept a `parallelRoutesKey`, which allows you to read the active route segment within that slot.

```tsx app/layout.tsx
'use client'

import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'

export default function Layout(props: {
  //...
  auth: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const loginSegments = useSelectedLayoutSegment('auth')
  // ...
}
```

When a user navigates to `@auth/login`, or `/login` in the URL bar, `loginSegments` will be equal to the string `"login"`.

---

## Examples

### Modals

Parallel Routing can be used to render modals.

![Modals](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes-auth-modal.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

The `@auth` slot renders a `<Modal>` component that can be shown by navigating to a matching route, for example `/login`.

```tsx app/layout.tsx
export default async function Layout(props: {
  // ...
  auth: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {props.auth}
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx app/@auth/login/page.tsx
import { Modal } from 'components/modal'

export default function Login() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      {/* ... */}
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

To ensure that the contents of the modal don't get rendered when it's not active, you can create a `default.js` file that returns `null`.

```tsx app/@auth/default.tsx
export default function Default() {
  return null
}
```

---

#### Dismissing a modal

If a modal was initiated through client navigation, e.g. by using `<Link href="/login">`, you can dismiss the modal by calling `router.back()` or by using a `Link` component.

```tsx app/@auth/login/page.tsx
'use client'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { Modal } from 'components/modal'

export default function Login() {
  const router = useRouter()
  return (
    <Modal>
      <span onClick={() => router.back()}>Close modal</span>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      ...
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

> More information on modals is covered in the [Intercepting Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) section.

If you want to navigate elsewhere and dismiss a modal, you can also use a catch-all route.

![Dismissing a modal](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fparallel-routes-catchall.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

```tsx app/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.tsx
export default function CatchAll() {
  return null
}
```

> Catch-all routes take precedence over `default.js`.

---

### Conditional Routes

Parallel Routes can be used to implement conditional routing. For example, you can render a `@dashboard` or `@login` route depending on the authentication state.

```tsx app/layout.tsx
import { getUser } from '@/lib/auth'

export default function Layout({ dashboard, login }: { dashboard: React.ReactNode; login: React.ReactNode }) {
  const isLoggedIn = getUser()
  return isLoggedIn ? dashboard : login
}
```
