# Intercepting Routes

Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.

For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the `/photo/123` route, masks the URL, and overlays it over `/feed`.

However, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.

## Convention

Intercepting routes can be defined with the `(..)` convention, which is similar to relative path convention `../` but for segments.

You can use:

- `(.)` to match segments on the **same level**
- `(..)` to match segments **one level above**
- `(..)(..)` to match segments **two levels above**
- `(...)` to match segments from the **root** `app` directory

For example, you can intercept the `photo` segment from within the `feed` segment by creating a `(..)photo` directory.

> Note that the `(..)` convention is based on _route segments_, not the file-system.

## Examples

### Modals

Intercepting Routes can be used together with [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) to create modals.

Using this pattern to create modals overcomes some common challenges when working with modals, by allowing you to:

- Make the modal content **shareable through a URL**
- **Preserve context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal
- **Close the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route
- **Reopen the modal on forwards navigation**

![Modals](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fintercepted-routes-modal-example.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_AGVpExNSxGb3dC5jrZYnL2rzPEsj)

> In the above example, the path to the `photo` segment can use the `(..)` matcher since `@modal` is a _slot_ and not a _segment_. This means that the `photo` route is only one _segment_ level higher, despite being two _file-system_ levels higher.

Other examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated `/login` page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.
